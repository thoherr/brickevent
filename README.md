BRICKEVENT
==========

Overview
--------

This is a web registration application for the signup of exhibitors, staff and visitors at LUG events,
i. e. LEGO&reg; User Group (LUG) exhibitions.

The system was originally written for the registration of AFOLs (Adult Fans Of LEGO) for the LEGO KidsFest 2012 in Munich.

Currently still far too much of texts and structure is hard coded. All texts are of course available in german, but in the meantime most of them also have an english translation.

However, it is planned to further generalize this rails app in order to use it for several of the many AFOLs events in Germany, Europe and Worldwide.

In November 2016, Schwabenstein 2*4 e.V. joined the club and we introduced the LUG as Entity to this application.
Therefore, some of the UI is now dependent on the name this app is accessed (e. g. the logo).

Help from other IT affine LEGO fans is very welcome ;-).

Setup
-----

After cloning this repository do

    bundle

to get all required gems.

The database configuration file config/database.yml includes the variables

    DATABASE_NAME
    DATABASE_USERNAME
    DATABASE_PASSWORD

which you have to set in your environment for production.

Then

    rake db:migrate
    rake test

There is a Dockerfile provided for building a docker container for the App. The container can be build with

    docker build -t brickevent .

in the root directory of the project.

The filed docker/docker-compose.yml.template and docker/mysql/my.cnf.template can be used to setup a complete distribution on a docker host.

You also have to configure the file config/environments/production.rb for your installation. You probably want this file to be mapped via a docker volume mount, see docker/docker-compose.yml.template.

You can use the simple script tools/generate_config.sh to create the configuration files with generated passwords from these templates. The script takes the docker directory as parameter.


System requirements
-------------------

Currently the app uses Rails 7.1.2 and Sqlite3/MySQL.

Known Flaws
-----------

The application is multi-lingual (german/english at the moment), but texts in the content (e.g. event descriptions) only have a single field.
